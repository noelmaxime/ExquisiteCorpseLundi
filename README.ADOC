_The story of the grey hat_

Once upon a time a guy with a grey hat. All he wanted to do was to help people,
 but without advertising them.
Unfornutately his hat was so unfashionable that nobody woult talk to him.
He tried to help m'ladies. But none would acknoledge him and the supperior help
such a fine gentleman could give.
